Set up basic server 
make mongodb
set up schemas
create folder for routes and controllers
start with contrllers first, then routes, then mount

after making get and post, i was struggling a bit cause i started using thunder client. realised i needed:
    app.use(express.json());
in the middle ware, and bam it works


Testing:

using thunder client
{
    "title": "", 
    "body": "Noffin", 
    "author": "NoName"
}
