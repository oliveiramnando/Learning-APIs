Set up basic server 
make mongodb
set up schemas
create folder for routes and controllers
start with contrllers first, then routes, then mount

after making get and post, i was struggling a bit cause i started using thunder client. realised i needed:
    app.use(express.json());
in the middle ware, and bam it works

post for user: registration and login
    registration
        require password to have minimum length 
    login 

    bcrypt
        terminal : npm i bcrypt
        to hash password we need to create a salt, and then use that salt along with password to create a hashed password
            bcrypt takes care of this for us

    user.controllers
        require bcrypt
        

Testing:

using thunder client
{
    "title": "", 
    "body": "Noffin", 
    "author": "NoName"
}
