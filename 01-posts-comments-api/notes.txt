installed express 
    terminal : npm i express

made new project in mongodb website
    terminal : npm install mongodb
    terminal : npm i mongoose

added password to .env
install dotenv
    terminal : npm install dotenv

connected to db with mongoose at the bottom of server.js

wrote script in package.json -- npm run server

created models folder and schema for posts and comments
    requires mongoose at the top
    model the schema and export at the bottom

created middleware section in server.js:
    app.use(express.json());

created routes and contollers folder and files
    post.controller.js
        require post model at top
        export module of functions at bottom
        controller has the functions of CRUD
    post.routes.js
        require express and model at top // maybe dont even need model?? try it out
        express.Router()
        require functions from post.controller at top as well
        export router at the bottom
    add route in server.js

    comment.controller.js
        require comment model at top
        export module of functions at bottom
    comment.routes.js
        require express
        express.Router()
        require functions from comment.controller at top as well
        nested routes, be wary of req params; define routes relative to mount path
        export router at the bottom
    add route in server.js

started trying to automatically assign postId to comment from url
struggled with this
after adding mergparams to router, i was able to get this going; before i wasn't able to access postId

NOTE TO SELF:
query filtering next
then validation
