imported express, dotenv, mongoose
created basic set up
working on sign up for AuthController, will require a validator for the fields in middleware, and hashpassword in validator,
    worked on hasing.js 
        hashing passord on sign up  
        imported bcrypt
    working on validator for schema, requires joi  
        imorted joi
    ** add role when signing up later **

working on sign in AuthController will require a validator for the fields in middleware, and compare hashed password in validator,
    working on validator for sign in; actually can use the same validator for sign.
    working on compare hash value in hashing.js
    after checking email and password, must assign token
        imported jsonwebtoken
    npm i cookie-parser and require in server.js to read cookie

working on me, will need an identifier to return current user profile
    need identification in middleware
        require jwt in identification
    identification is how we do const { _id } = req.user;
    require cookieparser and use in server.js 

signout require identifier, clear cookie

starting rbac stuff
rbac router need protection
    we do this by access token (JWT) because we assidned role when we created it

added another middleware for authorize roles so that only certain roles can do certain things
started workin on controller for rbac
created a rolesSchema and permissionsSchema

worked on get permissions and get roles
for post roles will have to create a schema 
    created role and permission schema
work on the rest of rbac controller

working on patch for updating permissions but i've hit a road block
working on the rest of the controller functions for now
    was able to path admin

add and remove permission in rbac controller

*** tighten up rbac controller cause i know that is not perfect **

working on user router and controllers
    make it so that only admin can delete user

work on posts controller and router
    need createPost schema validator
    and update
    make so that assign user to post, make so that only user moderator and admin can crud anyone
        curreently struggling with this. ive assigned the author id to the post but i cant seem to make the crud selective
            i think the problem lies in the identification
                    properly read the headers in identification
                        client sends a request with a bearer token
                        identifier middleware runs first
                            It reads the raw token string from the request header (or cookie, if no header).
                            It strips off "Bearer " and verifies the JWT
                        The decoded payload is attached to req.user
                        Middleware sets req.user
                        Now any controller (like updatePost) can safely use req.user.
                after properly updating identification and adding debug logs, i properly updated the controller. what a learning experience that was    
                    use mongoose to handle some stuff
                    use mongodb query filter 
                    only update the provided fields


authRouter - everyone
postsRouter - normal users can CRUD their own, moderators/admin can CRUD anyones post
usersRouter - only admin can see/delete other users. Regular users canâ€™t.
rbac - only admin can read/manage roles/permissions.
