downloaded express, bcrypt, cookie-parser, cors, helmet, joi, jesonwebtoken, mongoose, nodemailer

created basic server and required dependencies
started authRouter
before authcontroller, made a validation in middleware to check if user has provided our data to us
    validator.js:
        responsible for checking if the incoming request data is valid before backend processes it
        schema in validator.js defines what is required
        joi is a data validation library
            Defines schemas (rules for data)
            Validates data against those schemas
            Prevents bad data from reaching your database or business logic
then created utils to hash password
